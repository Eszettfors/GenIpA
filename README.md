This project was created as a captstone project for the course GenAI for Humanists in S2024 at the univeristy of Vienna. The aim of the project ist to create a pipline to translate documents
into phonetic writing using the international phonetic alphabet and emerging techniques from the area generative AI and large language models. 

The main objectives are reliable conversion between orthography of pronounciation that is able to handle abiguity - which many text to phonetics struggle with.

Being able to deploy such a model on large amounts of data would be usefull in the area of judging automatic similarity of languages, as it would allow for large scale calulations of 
phonological distance measurements between languages. 

To achieve this, a large language modell will be fined tuned to the task of text to ipa conversion using the data of monolingual wordlists with pronounciation information
made availble through the ipa-dict project: https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict
